# Coded TeraSort
Application of single parity check single-parity-check (SPC) codes to distributed key-value (KV) pair sorting algorithm ([TeraSort](http://sortbenchmark.org/YahooHadoop.pdf)). 

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (g++)
- Open MPI up to v.2.1 (tested with Open MPI v.1.10.2)

## Execution instructions

### MapReduce parameters
You should first set the number of MPI server processes (not including the master). This is the variable `numReducer` in `CodedConfiguration.h`.  At the same file, choose the parameters `k`,`q` such that the number of servers is `K=kq`. The Open MPI hostfile of the master machine should contain the hostnames of the computing servers or you can manually specify a hostfile when running the code.  

### Files and file paths
The data set file of the key-value (KV) pairs to be sorted should be set in the `inputPath` directory of `CodedConfiguration.h`.  Each line of this file is a 10-byte key followed by a 90-byte value and can be generated by [Hadoop's](http://hadoop.apache.org/) TeraGen utility.  For demonstration purposes, we have included a data set of 10000 KV pairs, named `Input10000`.  The path `outputPath` should exist on all servers. Finally, you should choose the number of KV samples picked for partitioning of the key domain. 

### TeraSort Execution
Run `make` to compile `CodedTeraSort`.

Run `mpirun -mca btl ^openib -mca plm_rsh_no_tree_spawn 1 ./InputPlacement` to split the data set and place the subfiles to the server machines.

Run `mpirun -mca btl ^openib -mca plm_rsh_no_tree_spawn 1 ./CodedTeraSort` to execute the algorithm.
